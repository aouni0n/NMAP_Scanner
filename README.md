2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:
`python nmap_scan.py`
4. Follow the prompts and provide the required information:
- Enter the target IP address or hostname.
- Choose the type of scan: `detailed` or `simple`.
5. The script will execute the Nmap scan and display the results in the terminal.
